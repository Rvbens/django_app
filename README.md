# Door_code_app

Basic django app to show the code of a door to a list of people who have the app. The code is set by an admin manually both on the app and on the physical door, and only accounts activated by the admin can see the code. The admin can also see a log of the people who has seen the code and when.

The project can evolve in the future, by making the app generate the code and connecting it to the door with via Raspberry Pi or Arduino, making the system fully automated. Also codes can be made personal for extra security.
